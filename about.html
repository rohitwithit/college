                In a short span of time the school has earned a lot of reputation and popularity for providing latest,
                quality education and fulfilling growing needs for the skilled professionals, of the ever-changing

                Enough laboratory time is made available to the students for maximum utilization of the computing
                facilities. Our main strength is highly qualified & experienced faculty members, who are very
                enthusiastic in learning new technologies and updating their skill sets. Faculty members are always
                ready to guide students apart from regular teaching hours and maintaining the disciplined behavior in
                the departments.
                <br>
                We maintain a very inclusive, feel-at-home & open culture in the premise, because we believe in
                progressive unfoldment of the students towards becoming perfect IT professionals. The department not

                discipline, high Moral values, Competitiveness & Team spirit in our students, which leads to the overall
                personality development of the students.</p>
